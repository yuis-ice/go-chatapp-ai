## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please be respectful, considerate, and constructive in all interactions.

### Our Standards

**Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:**
- Using welcoming and inclusive language

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/yuis-ice/go-chatapp-ai/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/yuis-ice/go-chatapp-ai/discussions) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in that issue.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open a [Discussion](https://github.com/yuis-ice/go-chatapp-ai/discussions/new?category=q-a)
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into
- Provide project and platform versions (Go version, OS, browser, etc.)
- Include relevant code snippets or error messages

We will then take care of the question as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side (check documentation, Go version compatibility, etc.)
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Version of Go, browser, and possibly other relevant software
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/yuis-ice/go-chatapp-ai/issues/new/choose)
- Use the **Bug Report** template
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for the Go Real-time Chat App, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version
- Read the [documentation](README.md) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/yuis-ice/go-chatapp-ai/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/yuis-ice/go-chatapp-ai/issues).

- Use the **Feature Request** template
- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users
- List some other chat applications or similar projects where this enhancement exists

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/yuis-ice/go-chatapp-ai/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/yuis-ice/go-chatapp-ai/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues

#### Local Development Setup

See [Development Setup](#development-setup) section below for detailed instructions.

### Improving The Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome! This includes:

- README improvements
- Code comments
- API documentation
- Tutorial content
- Example improvements

## Styleguides

### Go Code Style

- Follow standard Go formatting (`go fmt`)
- Use `go vet` to check for suspicious code
- Follow effective Go practices
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for exported functions and complex logic
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused

**Example:**
```go
// HandleWebSocket upgrades HTTP connections to WebSocket and manages the client lifecycle
func HandleWebSocket(hub *Hub, w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    conn, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("WebSocket upgrade failed: %v", err)
        return
    }
    
    username := getUsername(r)
    client := NewClient(conn, username)
    
    hub.Register(client)
    go client.ReadPump(hub)
    go client.WritePump()
}
```

### Frontend Code Style

- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)
- Follow semantic HTML structure
- Use CSS classes over inline styles
- Write clear, readable JavaScript
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic

**Example:**
```javascript
// Establish WebSocket connection with error handling
function connectToChat(username) {
    const wsUrl = `ws://${window.location.host}/ws?username=${encodeURIComponent(username)}`;
    
    socket = new WebSocket(wsUrl);
    socket.onopen = handleConnectionOpen;
    socket.onmessage = handleMessage;
    socket.onerror = handleConnectionError;
}
```

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - üéâ `:tada:` when adding a new feature
  - üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  - üìö `:books:` when writing docs
  - üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  - ‚ö° `:zap:` when improving performance
  - üß™ `:test_tube:` when adding tests
  - üîß `:wrench:` when changing configuration files

**Examples:**
```
üéâ Add user presence indicators to chat interface

- Display online/offline status for users
- Update presence when users connect/disconnect
- Add green/gray indicator dots next to usernames

Fixes #123
```
